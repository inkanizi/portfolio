              Hello! My name is Brittany and I enjoy creating things that live
              on the internet. My interest in web development started back in
              2012 when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes â€” turns
              out hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about
              HTML & CSS!

              Fast-forward to today, and I ve had the privilege of working at an
              advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a
              student-led design studio. My main focus these days is building
              accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at
              Upstatement for a variety of clients.

              I also recently launched a course that covers everything you need
              to build a web app with the Spotify API using Node & React.
